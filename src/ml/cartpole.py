Step 1: Install keras-rl library
Step 2: Install dependencies for CartPole environment

import numpy as np
import gym

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Flatten
from keras.optimizers import Adam

from rl.agents.dqn import DQNAgent
from rl.policy import EpsGreedyQPolicy
from rl.memory import SequentialMemory

'''
Then set the relevant variables
'''

ENV_NAME = 'CartPole-v0'

# Get the environment and extract the number of actions available in the Cartpole problem
env = gym.make(ENV_NAME)
np.random.seed(123)
env.seed(123)
nb_actions = env.action_space.n

'''
Next, we build a very simple single hidden layer neural network model.
'''

model = Sequential()
model.add(Flatten(input_shape=(1,) + env.observation_space.shape))
model.add(Dense(16))
model.add(Activation('relu'))
model.add(Dense(nb_actions))
model.add(Activation('linear'))
print(model.summary())


'''
Next, we configure and compile our agent. We set our policy as Epsilon Greedy and we also set our memory as Sequential Memory because we want to store the result of actions we performed and the rewards we get for each action.
'''

policy = EpsGreedyQPolicy()

memory = SequentialMemory(limit=50000, window_length=1)

dqn = DQNAgent(model=model, nb_actions=nb_actions, memory=memory, nb_steps_warmup=10,target_model_update=1e-2, policy=policy)

dqn.compile(Adam(lr=1e-3), metrics=['mae'])

# Okay, now it's time to learn something! We visualize the training here for show, but this slows down training quite a lot.
dqn.fit(env, nb_steps=5000, visualize=True, verbose=2)

Now we test our reinforcement learning model
